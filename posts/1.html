<h3>How Has Your Perspective on the World Changed Since You Were 18? What Would You Tell Your Younger Self?</h3>
        <div>OP turned 18 today. <br><br>Turned from Nietzscheanism to Absurdism; got influenced by Socrates&#x27; writings and Witgenstein&#x27;s books. <br>Can&#x27;t let go Humayun Ahmed&#x27;s Hemu,<br>And spent my teenage years day dreaming about a life like Zura of Duranta Egol.<br><br>Animesh from Kalbela felt like a hero, but then Dr. Moni Bhowmik and Elon Musk took their place. <br><br>13 years went by reading and thinking about &quot;how to think&quot; and &quot;whom to think like&quot;, now I feel overwhelmed. <br><br>Any insights are appreciated! <br><br></div>

        <p><span class="author">chhaptilak</span>: Happy birthday! I am 39 and I believe I have changed in every year of my life, so my mind is basically Ship of Theseus compared to when I was 18. And I hope to change further as I age, otherwise what good are my life experiences?<br><br><br>As I get older, I find that my ideological stance has softened to empathize with and make space for people I might not necessarily relate to, people who might not have met my high standards as an 18 year old. I have now met enough people to not believe in “first impressions” and “body language”, and neither align myself with a particular ideology anymore. I have become more impatient and outspoken than before, and probably a lot more cynical, especially of establishment figures (like Elon Musk ;D). I have great faith in the younger generation to change the world for better and I wish that my generation left the world a better and more habitable place for the young. I am still chasing career goals, but ambition has taken a backseat to family, and material things have bowed out to experiences.<br><br><br>I recommend the book “Designing Your Life”, I wish that you read it as a young person. I certainly became more intentional and mindful about my priorities in life after reading it a few years back. I don’t know if it made me selfish or self-aware, but I find myself thinking about my legacy - about what I want the sum total of my life to be, but also in a rather mundane way - I recently made a last will and testament purely to make the logistics of my death a bit easier for my family.</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: That&#x27;s a wonderful journey, I love your comment, re-read 2 times and saving it for future. <br>Will definitely give that book a read! <br>Thanks a lot, all the best wishes :D</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Either-Let-331</span>: First of all, happy birthday, balik balak.  <br>Second of all... I have no idea either, I just got here..  <br>I guess we just keep pushing through in life going from one point to another, figuring out its ups and downs, that&#x27;s just how life goes.. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think spiraling down the philosophical lane is going to to much good to one.</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: im considering the importance of the last sentence to be tremendous...</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Hairy-Willow5338</span>: I don&#x27;t know, I just turned 18 too.</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: Buckle up, fellow soldier </p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">CeeHaz0_0</span>: Happy Birthday, OP. Hope you have an amazing year ahead.<br><br><br>My perspective has been evolving constantly since I was 18. I am more practical now, I say things on people&#x27;s faces and don&#x27;t gossip on the back. Definitely have less tolerance to nasty, opportunists and toxic a-holes. <br><br>Any advice to my younger self? Nothing much. I had a good childhood. I was innocent, naive and stupid, that&#x27;s how kids are supposed to be. So glad we didn&#x27;t have social media growing up.<br><br> So I was a pretty much normal child. Won&#x27;t change anything about it.</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: &amp;gt; say things on people&#x27;s faces<br><br><br>Have been in a lot of troubles for these, now I like to think like a chess game </p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">CeeHaz0_0</span>: Good for you, dude. Have a good birthday!</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Candid_Discipline159</span>: First of all, Happy Bday OP!<br>To think about this, on your 18th b&#x27;day, is quite impressive.<br><br>I can relate with you (kind of). Ever since I got into philosophy, I used to have a mix of thoughts and emotions.<br><br>Hopeless, thinking life doesn&#x27;t really make sense most of the time, <br>hopeful about the future,<br>Lots of confusion as to &#x27;how to live&#x27;- should I enjoy life a lil bit more or...this time isn&#x27;t going to come back again, time to hustle and grind<br>Should I be more social or...just myself?<br><br>The thing I realised is that I was just thinking and thinking and thinking about something which people usually figure out by doing<br><br>We all are trying to figure out what is exactly going on in our lives and I think, we all continue to do that till we kick the bucket at the end<br><br>Also, everybody experiences different situations in their life. So it&#x27;s better to not take everybody&#x27;s advice very seriously, coz it&#x27;s not necessary that if &#x27;a certain way of living&#x27; worked for someone, that it might work for you as well. Well that&#x27;s one life lesson I&#x27;ve learnt the hard way.</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  What i understood is that adaptation is the key;<br> and figuring stuffs out on the way, (might not be at that moment but 2 steps ahead) is better. Thinking 20 steps ahead ain&#x27;t practical, nor at step 0.  Am i right? </p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Candid_Discipline159</span>: Yes. More of flexibility and balance, less of overthinking</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Real-Swordfish-2805</span>: 28 here. <br>Things I learnt about the world is : Nothing is secure.Your ability to accept the truth that&#x27;s not in your favor and make necessary changes, is what will help you in the long run.<br><br>Insurance company benefits from your fear of dying early.<br>Education system benefits from your fear of not being enough.<br>Political system benefits from your fear of being outnumbered by a differing ideology.<br>Economic system is being run by big corporates who are cashing on arbitrage from funds &quot;saved&quot; by fearful people. <br><br>That the entire Human Social System works on Fear psychosis. Each human has their own set of challenges and no one is above another in terms of wealth or education. Yes, having these two definitely allows you some leverage in certain aspects. That&#x27;s it.  That you can be entirely in right and still be admonished. <br>Enlightenment and scientific discoveries have not entirely changed the basic essence of Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;; it has just transformed the instrument of &quot;Power&quot;.<br><br>That human mind is an empty vessel. Everything you read in the books is not necessarily how things are going on in the world.<br><br>If you&#x27;re from Science background, Read Art; and vice-versa.<br>While Science makes you Rational, Art makes you humane. In real Life, you&#x27;ll need a mix of both.<br><br>At 18 you&#x27;ve people in your circle doing the same things, there seems to be an inherent familiarity. It gives you a sense of safety.<br><br>At 28, some people are doing the same thing, but not necessarily in your circle; that can give you a FOMO and make you despise your Life. Don&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s pointless. The people who seem to be happy on Social media are doing the exact same thing.</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">wind-up-bird-_</span>: Reading your comment put a smile on my face. Although I&#x27;m not 18 anymore, i think I needed to read this, because it resonates so much with me. You have put down some Universal values  to certain universal struggles a person has to face, no matter if they are 18, or 25, or 30. :)</p></div></div><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: &amp;gt; it has just transformed the instrument of &quot;Power&quot;<br><br><br> 😭 So much well said. Everyone puts be down for saying this.  <br><br><br> Loved your comment..really thought provoking. <br><br><br> Im from a science background, I try to read as much broadly as possible.. just try though.. Feynman lectures are my favourite so are Tarapodo Ray and Bibhutibhushan&#x27;s writings.

(albeit for a brief period of time and the movie has looked over that part).

These are also some observations I&#x27;ve cleaned over the years:<br><br>18-22 are some of the amazing years you&#x27;ll have in your life, if everything goes right. You&#x27;ll be going to college soon, making new friends and meeting all kinds of people...and doing all kinds of things, most of which you&#x27;ve never done before. Make sure to follow the principle of &quot;it&#x27;s not that deep, I&#x27;m not going to take life seriously&quot;, and allow yourself to get embraced by the craziness that these years of youth brings. I myself spent these crucial years (although, I&#x27;m only a few years older now from 22) being anxious about my career and studies, only to realise that it&#x27;ll all fall into place eventually and to get carried away by overthinking and unchecked anxiety prevents me from enjoying what I have/had at that present moment. It wasn&#x27;t as deep as I had thought it was. <br><br>I&#x27;d also suggest, to keep an open mind to All kinds of experience, and to not outright decline any opportunity/experience that comes your way. Of course, you&#x27;ll have to weigh the pros and cons of things and not be a fool to dive straight into danger - but, keep an open mind, and don&#x27;t say No to things that seem foreign to you. <br><br><br>Also remember, that the friends that you make during this period, might not be your life-long friends. That doesn&#x27;t mean, that their friendship doesn&#x27;t matter. It matters, because they&#x27;ll be a part of a very crucial phase of your life. You might lose them over the years, but it&#x27;ll be amazing while it lasts. And who knows, maybe some of the friendships will also last? All the best!!</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: I&#x27;ve noted down the points.

If you try to think like someone then I can&#x27;t even think. You should only think like yourself. Yes, your thinking may be influenced but never try to think like someone. It&#x27;s their truth. Find your truth by yourself.</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: trying, will keep on trying </p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">baaler_username</span>: Happy Birthday!!<br><br>When I was 18, I was delusional.

You will feel like rest a bit or i can do it later or other day. Just dont do it. Be very punctual about your timings, make a schedule or routine and follow that rigorously. Im 31 years old, yes i got success in terms of my salary and all. I do earn more than average but, now i realise that i did wasted a lot of time in my teenage years. I feel regret that i was careless and to get the success i have i had to work like crazy 14 hours or more day for two years. So my advice is study, develop skills and self taught yourself things you are interested in. Let go from all your expectations because when you start working it would be easier for you to migrate into new reality/life.</p></div><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">
Glad-Departure-2001</span>: Read Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem in 2nd year of engineering. Everything changed. Now I had mathematical proof that all ideologies are “incomplete”. It helped me become a lot less “aantelectual” and helped me focus on the structure of epistemology with a mathematical logic twist. What is knowledge, belief, and how you can use what kind of logic to arrive at them?<br>
Decomposing any ideology to it’s constituent axioms and rules of inference is the most sure way to detect it’s “incompleteness” boundaries, and detecting BS.
</p><div class="reply"><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Apprehensive-Key9995</span>: thanks ive saved your comment for further research in the future.
few days back i had looked into godel incompleteness theorem while looking into https://github.com/NeoVertex1/SuperPrompt/blob/2d892d58eaa162ee9d08bbad102ba73dcef7a3a5/Readme.md?plain=1#L162 , got a vague superficial idea of what it is..could not grasp it completely though.</p><div class="comment"><p><span class="author">Glad-Departure-2001</span>: 

Just remember to never do "philosophy" without mathematical rigor. That way lies BS. If you can't do Lambda Calculus, you can't do logic. What you can do is at best a Simulacrum.

Worrying about the "incompleteness" (~"boundary conditions", "dependencies", "risks") of anything complex is what any scientific endeavor do most of the time. In my line of work, I spend 90% obsessing over these boundaries, if I was designing semiconductor chips or rocket engines - that would be 99.99999% of the time.

I went to Shantiniketan. My metamorphosis from 17YO "aantel" wandering about in USS to 20YO no-BS me was striking to say the least.
